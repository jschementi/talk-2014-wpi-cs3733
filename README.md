# Computer Science after College

These slides were used while speaking to Gary Pollice’s software engineering
class at WPI on 11/18/2014.

Gary, it was an honor to speak to your students, especially as this
is the last time you're offering this course at WPI. I’m sure I speak for a
decades-worth of Software Engineers when I say, thank you - may we be the best
of all your personas.
